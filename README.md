# odin-recipes
My current project was to create a web page about recipes using git, gut hub, and the html language.

I learned to create links on a webpage (absolute and relative), commit messages to git and publish my webpage on github. 

Overall, the project seemed easy to me as I felt I fully grapsed the concepts.
