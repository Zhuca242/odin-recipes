        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> This is a rather <em>simple</em> alternative to the more popular and more time consuming beef stroganoff.
            For all those <strong>lazy people</strong> out there like me, this recipe is for you.</p>
            
            <p> <em>One plate of this will fill you up in no time!</em> </p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>  
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can fat-free condensed cream of mushroom soup</li> 
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>  
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>      
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ALL ingredients</li>
            <li>Sauté ground beef in a large skillet 
            over medium heat until browned and crumbly; 
            5 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly 
                salted water and bring to a rapid boil.
                cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite,
                7 to 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li> Drain and discard any fat from the cooked beef. Stir condensed
                 soup and garlic powder into the beef. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li>Remove beef from the heat. Add egg noodles and stir to combine. Stir in sour cream 
                and season with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
